## Overview

The *Statistics for Social Justice* book (S4SJ) is written directly to and for social workers—not TPC or other communication design fields. However, throughout this course, I am asking us to translate concerns, issues, situations, and methods that we recognize as potentially overlapping and similar with communication professionals or even be inspired to invent different and new issues and methods for TPC.

The first three readings set us down this inventive path for the future of communication professionals to take up more data-driven, structural approaches to our work, ***or what could be our work***! Here's a basic rationale and use for each of the readings in the context of this course:

1. The S4SJ book provides us with the initial structure of concepts and statistical techniques to adapt into our own ***structural perspective*** to carry into and inform TPC.
2. Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence discuss and define what they call a social justice ethic. They briefly survey the social justice turn in TPC, and its exigence in response to the myriad ways ethics have been conceptualized and operationalized in TPC's past. This book chapter can help us gain a sense for where TPC has been and where it is going with regards to social justice work.
3. Graham et al's article can serve as an initial bridge for us to see an earlier work that introduces a mixed-methods approach to TPC scholarly research. While I don't expect us to fully understand the entirety of their statistical research method yet, I hope that we can begin to discuss and understand their argument that blends a bit of both the S4SJ structural perspective and TPC's future with a social justice ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.

## 1. Questions about "Why statistics are important"

### 1.1. Defining key terms

**Question**: Use the space below to define the provided key terms.

- According to the SFSJ authors, what is the main difference between **data** and **information**?: According to the SFSJ authors, data are the raw numbers/scores that come from qualitative and quantitative research, while information is the result of data being analyzed and interpreted. Essentially, a researcher collects data from their research and then analyzes and interprets that data to produce information. 
- **Variable**: A variable is a characteristic that varies from person to person. The SFSJ Chapter 1 reading gives the examples of gender, race, income, and education level, among others. 
- **Constant**: A constant is a characteristic that is the same for the subjects of research. For example, if a study focuses on a group of women, being a woman is a constant for that group. 
- **Conceptualization**: Conceptualization is the process of choosing and clearly defining the variables of your study. Having precise conceptualization helps others replicate the study or even just understand what the study is researching. 
- **Operationalization**: Operationalization is the method used to measure variables in a study, such as the reading's example of using a standardized instrument like the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. 
- **Nominal level of data**: A nominal level of data classifies observations into mutually exclusive categories that don't involve inherent orders or rankings. The reading gives the example of a yes or no question like "Are you employed?". 
- **Ordinal level of data**: An ordinal level of data classifies observations into mutually exclusive categories that have an inherent order; the reading's example is asking about level of education. 
- **Interval level of data**: An interval level of data classifies observations into mutually exclusive categories that have an inherent order and equal spacing between categories. 
- **Ratio level of data**: A ratio level of data classifies observations into mututally exclusive categories that have an inherent order, equal spacing, and a reflection of the absolute magnitude. The reading explains that most quantitative data is either this type or the interval level type. 

### 1.2. On positivism

**Question**: Describe how the S4SJ authors define and use the term **positivism**. How do they suggest it is different from **post-positivism**? According to the authors, why are both paradigms important to social workers? Now, how do you imagine it is important for TPC professionals?

The SFSJ authors define the term "positivism" as being a research paradigm that suggests that social behavior can be studied and understood in a scientific manner; logically, objectively, etc. The approach of this paradigm is that any variable that can't be represented by a measurement operation doesn't belong in science. 

The SFSJ authors suggest that post-positivism is different because it argues that scientific methods are too limiting and rigid to account for the complexity of human nature and relationships and the multiple voices that contribute to building social work knowledge. 

According to the authors, while there are valid critiques of positivism, it's still important for social workers to understand both paradigms because social work relies on quantitative methods to advocate for social change. The authors also assert that it's not the research method that's important for structural social work researchers, but the purpose, which is to promote social justice. 

I imagine TPC professionals also must hold both paradigms as important, and must be able to work with both to achieve the goal of promoting social change. The positivism paradigm is needed because a big part of being a TPC professional is working with data and quantitative methods of research, but the post-positivist paradigm is needed to ensure TPC professionals are coming from a place of advocating for others, taking the voices of marginalized groups into account, and acknowledging non-quantitative methods of research (like feminist theory, critical race theory, etc). 

### 1.3. On the "*structural perspective*"

**Question**: Name and define the different parts of the ***structural perspective***. Be sure to cover the parts related practice and research.

The structural perspective, which encourages social workers to seek social/structural change rather than change from the individuals being marginalized by society, was in part developed by Bob Mullaly. Mullaly felt that there were two competing perspectives within sociology, that being order and conflict, and felt that order aligns with neoliberal ideology, which pushes the idea that capitalism is an adequate economic system and will result in wealth trickling down to the lower classes. Order and neoliberal ideology perpetuate the idea that social problems are caused by people who don't follow society's riles, and mainstream social work has adopted this perspective, which is why it often involves helping individuals adapt to society's expectations. Mullaly's structural perspective instead adopts the conflict perspective and Marxist ideology, which perpetuate the idea that groups with more power are able to oppress others and that society is a struggle between these groups. Ultimately, Mullaly asserts that there are two goals to the structural perspective: alleviating the negative effects people experience from being exploited and marginalized by society, and changing the conditions and social structures that cause these negative effects.

There are five practice/research parts to the structural perspective: Defence of the Client, Collectivization, Materialization, Increasing Client Power in the Worker-Client Relationship, and Enhancing Client Power Through Personal Change. Defence of the Client refers to social workers using the structural perspective to help defend their clients from oppressive systems, as many clients are unfamiliar with their own rights and need an advocate to properly seek justice. Collectivization is about social workers letting clients know that they aren't alone in their struggles and that their problems aren't stemming from individual shortcomings, as well as connecting them with support networks and helping them feel less isolated. Materialization is about making material analyses to show clients the connection between their poverty and mental health issues as a way of assuring them that it isn't their fault. 

Increasing Client Power in the Worker-Client Relationship refers to social workers increasing the power clients feel in the worker-client relationship by using clear language, sharing the reasons for proposed actions, and ensuring clients can see what's in their files, with the ultimate goal of helping the client feel that they are in control of their own problems and solutions. Finally, Enhancing Client Power Through Personal Change refers to the social worker's challenge of maximizing their client's potential for personal change of destructive thoughts and behaviors - without showing judgement or blame. Instead, social workers should focus on clients' strengths and help them make important connections between these destructive thoughts/behaviors and their social context.  

## 2. Questions about "The history of empiricism"

### 2.1. On feminist empiricism

**Question**: According to the SFSJ authors, what is ***feminist empiricism***? And, what issues does it recognize as important to recognize and remedy? Be sure to discuss why it emphasizes the importance of critically reflecting on aspects of the ***context*** of empirical work.

According to the SFSJ authors, feminist empiricism accepts the basic principles of traditional empericism, but simultaneously aims to improve upon it by including values in science. It agrees that only knowledge based on direct observation should be accepted as scientific fact, and also agrees that science is about formulating hypotheses to test again experience, but it disagrees with the notion that the scientific method must be free of values. It seeks to recognize and remedy the issue of researchers taking objective, detached, value-free positions in their research, claiming that this lack of values and emotional attachment isn't feasible and shouldn't be desired because it prevents the researcher/empiricist from recognizing that their research is being influenced by social factors and biases. Feminist empiricism also encourages empiricists to acknowledge their own emotions and values in their social work, feeling that these things can improve the research.

The SFSJ authors also touch on contextual feminist empiricism (developed by Helen Longino), which argues that the "constitutive" values (rules of what's acceptable) and "contextual" values (social and cultural values) of science are not completely distinct of each other, and that scientific knowledge _is_ social knowledge and therefore can only be accessed by empiricists who work within a community context and acknolwedge the political, social and cultural contexts of science. Essentially, this view adds onto feminist empiricism by asserting that it's important to critically reflect on the "contexts" of science (both constitutive and socially/culturally) and bring them together to gather empirical research that embraces scientific investigation while still recognizing social contexts.

## 3. Questions About "The future of ethics and social justice" in TPC

### 3.1. On the "*socially just ethic*"

**Question**: Name and define some of what you deem as the main different parts of the ***socially just ethic***. Be sure to discuss how it is different from other ethical approaches.

The SJ ethic differs from some of the more traditions ethical philosophies in that instead of focusing on encouraging individuals to participate in "good" moral behavior, it focuses on building coalitions that advocate for social and structural change. It also differs in that it centers around a specific set of ethical values and practices, like the importance of social workers advocating for oppressed groups and working toward change. SJ ethics also assert the importance of educating and reflecting on different forms of oppression, including cultural imperialism, marginalization, and intersectional oppression. I think it's also important to note that SJ ethics don't necessarily see inclusivity/accessibility as a universal good (unlike other perspectives), instead asserting that there are some situations where exclusivity is important and where TC professionals must consider which audiences have the most important values or needs. SJ ethics define exclusivity as a consequence of communicating, not a moral wrong. 

### 3.2. Defining critical issues

**Question**: Briefly define each of the critical issues discussed: Cultural Imperialism, Marginalization, and Intersectional Oppression.

**Cultural Imperialism**: The practice of white-European colonizers violently oppressing minority groups by stealing their land, exploiting them for slave labor, and extracting their resources for personal gain, as well as attempting to erase the minority group's culture and assimilate them into the colonizing culture. 

**Marginalization**: When specific groups of people are excluded from meaningfully participating in society and are forced to live as outsiders on the "margins" of society. The reading gives the example of Native tribes, who, through legislation from the U.S. government, have had their land, rights, language, and sovereignty stripped from them, and currently face extremely high poverty and drop-out rates. 

**Intersectional Oppression**: When oppression against different groups intersects due to people belonging to more than one of these groups. For example, as the reading notes, Black mothers experience oppression that is an intersection of misogyny and racism, and this intersection of oppression impacts many different parts of their life, including the medical care they receive and the spaces they have access to. 

### 3.3. Defining the 3Ps to help us recognize oppression

**Question**: Define each of the 3Ps below. Explain how each helps us recognize oppression.

**Power**: Power refers to the amount of influence and abilities different social groups have over others. The reading asserts that it can be used as a framework to assess oppressive social groups through the "matrix of domination", which organizes power across four domains: structural power (how institutions are connected and benefit from their power to reorganize social and technical relationships at the expense of marginalized groups), disciplinary power (how hegemonies manage and control their power and which rules apply to whom), interpersonal power (how everyday, micro-level interactions of individuals uphold institutional power), and hegemonic power (which encompasses all these domains and views them as a system of ideas for rationalizing how power is organized and distributed).

**Privilege**: According to the reading, privilege is the constraints and affordances individuals are granted or subjected to due to their positionality; for example, white women having more privilege than non-white women, men having more privilege than women, etc. 

**Positionality**: Positionality reflects the identities of individuals and groups in the context of structural oppression. Instead of seeing identity as essential and static, positionality understands aspects of identity as inter-relational, changing across times and contexts, and occasionally being contradictory. The reading gives the example of white women, whose positionality means they experience sexism and misogyny, but aren't subjugated to racism like non-white women are. 

### 3.4. Why an SJ ethic?

**Question**: Why do Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence position a "SJ ethic" as essential to the future of TPC? What types of problems does it help TPC tackle?

Lindgren, Gerdes and Lawrence assert that the SJ ethic is essential to the future of TPC because it allows TPCs to make ethical decisions that take different (sometimes intersecting or oppositonal) forms of oppression into account and work to make genuine structural change. SJ ethics focus on advocating for individuals by working toward collective action to address structural injustices, making it better suited for combating oppressive systems and groups than traditional ethics. 

## 4. Questions About "Statistical Genre Analysis" (SGA)

### 4.1. On "big" data

**Question**: How do Graham et al define and discuss what constitutes "big" data? How does their definition differ from what you have heard before you read this article?

Instead of defining "big data" as datasets that are extremely big in terms of size, Graham et al define it as data that exceeds the capabilities of current methodological techniques. With this definition, datasets are "big" if they are so complex or wide-reaching that none of the available methods of investigation (rhetorical analysis, genre analysis, etc.) can adequately capture the data's full scope or make a meaningful comparison - which is why SGA is needed (according to the reading). Prior to reading this article, I didn't hear the term "big data" often, but in general I assumed it just meant datasets that were large in size, which is the definition the reading acknowledges before providing the sociological TC definition.  

### 4.2. On SGA

**Question**: Summarize the following parts of SGA:

1. What TPC problems SGA addresses,
2. What data they used to demonstrate its potential,
3. What questions SGA data and methods enable TPC to ask, and
4. What methods it uses to do so.

## 6. Translating the structural approach into TPC / Other Humanities Fields

**Question**: After considering all of these texts -- their exigencies, propositions, and methods -- translate Mullaly's broader definition of the *structural approach* and Moreau's *practice methods* in social work into the domain of TPC or humanist domain of work by putting them into conversation with Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence's SJ ethic and Graham et al's statistical genre analysis. In other words, begin to develop your own structural perspective and set of practices that translates Moreau's 5 practices. Finally, add one new practice approach specific to TPC/your domain.
