## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/X.x--lastname`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

In chapter 2.1, we started thinking about translating more quantitive practices into typically humanities-oriented professional practices. In this chapter, we remember the value of humanist values and critical thinking, and I ask that we consider how the two are not mutually exclusive, but are, instead, complimentary and integral for a socially just ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.

## 1. Question about "Seven intersectional feminist principles ..."

### 1.1 Data and power

**Question**: According to D'Ignazio and Klein, what principles concern data and "power"? Define and discuss each principle below. Be sure to note the important questions to ask about data and power.

D'Ignazio and Klein name seven principles for challenging power with data: examine power, challenge power, elevate emotion and embodiment, rethink binaries and heirarchies, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible. 

1. Examine power: This principle is about examining the ways power (aka structural privilege and structural oppression) operates in the world and how systems benefit those they were designed for and marginalize those they weren't. It's noted that there are three questions data feminism asks about power in data science: who is the data science for, who is it by, and whose goals and interests does it uphold? 

2. Challenge power: This principle is about challenging the unequal distribution of power in the world and righting/redistributing it instead of just exposing it. Here, the authors bring up the method of considering counterdata. 

3. Elevate emotion and embodiment: This principle is about challenging the idea that TC and data science must be neutral, rational, and objective, and allowing emotion and identity to play a role in research and TC work. 

4. Rethink binaries and hierarchies: This principle is about reconsidering the gender binary and hierarchy and understanding how false binaries and hidden hierarchies influence data collection and categorization, as well as looking at issues through the lens of gender or without the lens of the gender binary. 

5. Embrace pluralism: This principle is about recognizing the importance of bringing together multiple perspectives (from a wide range of people and communities) into the knowledge-making process to gain more detailed, accurate and truthful knowledge. 

6. Consider context: This principle is about considering the context of data instead of viewing data as neutral and objective. Social and cultural contexts can play a role in the findings of data, so it only makes sense to acknowledge these contexts. 

7. Make labor visible: This principle is about making labor visible and ensuring people are properly compensated, valued and named, especially when their labor is invisible or often forgotten about. The reading gives the example of social media employees who were unable to complete their usual tasks during COVID-19, leading to inaccurate Google browser search results and more spam on Facebook. 

### 1.2 Data: Objective mirror, or not?

**Question**: What do D'Ignazio and Klein mean by issues of "false binaries and hidden hierarchies" (p. 3)? Then, explain how principles 3, 5, 6 and 7 each approach such issues.

The term 'false binaries' refers to situations where society attempts to force something to be either one thing or the other, not allowing for nuance or fluidity/spectrum. The reading uses examples like male vs female (when there are actually more than 2 genders) and emotion vs science (when the two can actually coexist and be combined).  

Hidden hierarchies are arrangements of structural power/authority that go unnoticed. The reading gives the example of gender, which has an invisible hierarchy that puts men at the top in all areas of life from social institutions to leadership roles. 

Principle 3 (elevate emotion and embodiment) approaches the false binary of emotions vs. data science by challenging it and suggesting that two aren't mutually exclusive. It asserts that valuing emotion helps keep data science grounded in reality. 

Principle 5 (embrace pluralism) approaches the false binary of individual perspectives vs. group perspectives by rejecting it in favor of pooling perspectives from a mix of both individuals and groups. 

Principle 6 (consider context) encourages considering the context of data instead of remaining neutral or objective. This involves directly addressing and challenging hidden hierarchies within race, gender, financial status, etc. 

Prinicple 7 (make labor visible) approaches hidden hierarchies by recognizing and fairly compensating the labor of others, including members of marginalized groups who may not have otherwise been recognized due to being at the bottom of a hidden hierarchy (race, gender, etc). 
 
## 2. Questions about Queer Data

### 2.1 Defining "queer data" & "intersectional LGBTQ data"

**Question**: Create a bulleted list of short excerpts and summary statements where Guyan defines "queer data" and "intersectional LGBTQ data" in the introduction. Be sure to accompany all excerpts and paraphrases with page number locations in the PDF.

- "Queer data is a tension." (p. 12, excerpt)
- "Queer data captures the particular meanings of queer identities across time and space and establishes them as categories for calculations and decision-making." (p. 12, summary)
- "Using queerness as categories is at odds with the queering of data, which asks critical questions about the foundations of these categories, the privileges some identities get over others, and which individuals benefit from the collection and use of queer data." (p. 12, summary)
- "Queer data is more than a study of individuals that sit outside the categories of heterosexual or cisgender." (p. 12, excerpt)
- "Queer data is a blunt, confrontational way of challenging traditional understandings of the intersection between data and identities. It disrupts binaries within gender, race, and sex, and rejects the notion that 'numbers speak for themselves', asserting that sometimes, the numbers actually speak for marginalized groups." (p.12, summary)
- "Queer data isn't just using data to share the stories and experiences of the LGBTQ community; it's an opportunity to provide more representation for LGBTQ people and reflect them in data." (p.19, summary)
- "Using an intersectional perspective for analysis makes it easier to identify new challenges and unique qualities." (p.29, summary)
- "Intersectional LGBTQ data tells a nuanced story that better reflects the messy and overlapping experiences of people's everyday lives." (p.29, excerpt)
- "Queer data isn't about removing the categories of gender and sex altogether, or increasing the diversity and size of data collected to try and achieve total knowledge. It's about giving LGBTQ people the ability to consistently review the value of participating in data collection, evaluate instances where data structures can be reformed, and withdraw their consent and call for the abolition of data practices if the potential for harm is more than the potential for good." (p.33, summary)

**Question**: Based on your list above, write your own movie tagline, i.e., a short and entertaining one-liner that tries to capture one of the main aspects of "queer data", and another tagline about "intersectional LGBTQ data."

**Queer Data Tagline**: 

_Queer Data: Breaking down binaries and combatting categorization_

**Intersectional LGBTQ data tagline**: 

_Life is messy, nuanced, and intersectional. Why shouldn't queer data be the same?_

### 2.2 Guyan's exigence for the book

**Question**: Why did Guyan write this book? What was his exigence?

Guyan wrote this book to encourage researchers, activists, and practitioners to change the ways they think about data, and to ask critical questions about why data is collected, why specific methods are used, and whose interests it serves. He wants to call attention to the conflicts, intersectionality, and nuance within queer lives and have those things be reflected in queer data so that it can be used to actually provide benefit to the LGBTQ community by breaking down/reforming the structures that contribute to the marginalization of queer people. He also wrote it to reflect his own background of not being an academic, scholar, or statistician, but having an interest in research and policy related to data and identity. Guyan wanted to respond to misconceptions he had heard related to data about LGBTQ people, as well as the lack of data literacy that compels people to read headline numbers and do no further research. 

### 2.3 "Prescriptive" versus "descriptive"

**Question**: What does Guyan mean when he labels terms like gender, sex, and sexuality as being descriptiveâ*not* prescriptive (see pp. 13-14 in particular)? Explain the differences between the two with an example from each of the terms.

Guyan means that these labels are intended to help describe the fluid, nuanced, varied experiences and characteristics of queer people (the spectrums of gender, sex, and sexuality that queer people experience and that need to be reflected in data), not to enforce strict rules about who does or doesn't fit these labels or to try and claim authority over these identities. For gender, descriptive terms help people describe their experience with gender and leave room for the nuances and non-binary identities of gender and gender expression, while being perscriptive could look like trying to force individuals to label their gender definitively, such as making them pick between 'boy' or 'girl' when they don't feel comfortable with either label. It could also look like forcing someone to match their gender expression with their gender identity. With sex, perscriptive terms would likely attempt to conflate gender and sex despite the two being different things, or would attempt to force a binary sex system when sex isn't actually a binary thing. With sexuality, using terms perscriptively could look like trying to force the label of 'heterosexual' on someone because they're dating someone of a different sex, instead of taking into account whether the person has expressed interest in other sexes and whether both people identify with the gender they were assigned at birth (for example, if one person is AMAB and the other is AFAB, but the AFAB person is non-binary, heterosexual actually wouldn't be an accurate term). 

### 2.4 "'Visibility is a trap'"

**Question**: Guyan cites Foucault's idea about how "'visibility is a trap'" (p. 20 of the PDF). What does this expression mean, and why does Guyan draw parallels between Foucault's original use of it with issues of power and data? Be sure to illuminate your discussion with specific examples that Guyan uses in the book.

This expression means that power can operate as a sort of invisible prison, where those who aren't in power may feel unsure as to whether or not they're being watched by those in power, leading them to behave as if they're always being surveilled. Guyan draws parallels here to acknowledge that gathering data about marginalized groups (specifically the queer community here) isn't always a positive thing and can negatively impact the lives of LGBTQ people when used incorrectly. One example Guyan cites here is violence against trans people; though stats and data on trans violence are more visible than ever, the number of recorded charges continues to increase (page 30). Guyan also asserts that queer data carries the burden of proof of oppression against LGBTQ people (which requires the use of finite resources and the labor of researchers and activitists), making it unclear as to whether or not collecting evidence is actually currently contributing to meaningful change. 

## 3. Questions about "The topology of race"

**Context**: In this reading, you read a shorter excerpt from a longer review essay by Lee. In this review essay, Lee summarizes Kwame Anthony Appiah's collection of essays, *In My Father's House*, as a means of instigating new lines of inquiry for legal studies.

### 3.1 Race & racism: From conjecture to questions of definition

**Question**: Why does Lee think it important that Appiah changed the standard line of inquiry in legal studies from "whether racism exists" (p. 441) to "what race and racism are"? What "overdetermined" (p. 441) parts or race, i.e., issues about race, does this definitional question bring into focus for deliberation? Be sure to ***define*** and discuss Appiah's position about race as being essential/biological or not and being cultural or not. Indeed, pay close attention to Appiah's definition of culture.

### 3.2 Race as multiplicitous

**Question**: What does Lee mean by "race is always multiplicitous because social contexts are multiplicitous" (p. 447)? Use the Shaw v. Reno case to help you explain how this challenges both essentialist/biological definitions of race & Appiah's race as synonomous with culture.
