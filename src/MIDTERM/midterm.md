# Alyssa Johnson's JavaScript Midterm

- **Name**: Alyssa Johnson
- **Dataset**: meta-ads

## Overview

I decided to choose the meta-ads dataset because it strongly ties into two topics that interest me: one, advertising, and two, the use of media to incite political violence. I also thought it was really interesting that the data shows which ads were about Israel, since that connects to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. I also thought the variables (the currency used to purchase the ad, the amount spent on it, the number of impressions it received, etc.) would be fun to work with. 

```js
import {utcParse,utcFormat} from "d3-time-format";
```

Then, divide the notebook into meaningfully sections and subsections.
Use the following general scheme to revise as needed.

## Attach the data

In this section, be sure to make some small notes about the data and output it
in an executable js codeblock, so you can review it on the page interactively.
You can note its size, for instance, as well as any other notable insights
gleaned during your first glance.

Remember that this is a notebook, so you can treat it like one. `:-)`

## Convert Dates

Convert the dates, which are strings, into Date() objects with your own custom
D3.js parser and any formatters. Discuss any particular choices to format the
date data in any new ways.

Again, be sure to output your newly transformed data in executable codeblocks
for easier verification and reviewing.

## Grouping #1 - Name of grouping here

Explain your plan to group the data in a particular way here, before you do so.
At least one of the groupings should use some variation of D3's `.rollup()`, so
you can count particular grouped properties.

Provide a procedure of your grouping plan in an ordered list before the codeblock:

1. Coding_Action_1
2. Coding_Action_2
3. ...

Again, be sure to output your newly transformed data in executable codeblocks
for easier verification and reviewing.

## Grouping #2 - Name of grouping here

Explain your plan to group the data in a particular way here, before you do so.
At least one of the groupings should use some variation of D3's `.rollup()`, so
you can count particular grouped properties.

Provide a procedure of your grouping plan in an ordered list before the codeblock:

1. Coding_Action_1
2. Coding_Action_2
3. ...

Again, be sure to output your newly transformed data in executable codeblocks
for easier verification and reviewing.

## Reflection

Use the following prompt to guide your reflection about your data work:
"What 2-3 insights and 2-3 questions did you glean from your initial work
with the dataset?"

Use the PR-TEMPLATE prompts to reflect on the midterm experience.
